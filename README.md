# SLALOM

SLALOM (SoLAr CelL Multivariate OptiMizer) is a set of open-source Python programs implementing 
a rigorous mathematical methods for the optimization of solar cells using as backend 
a drift-diffusion device simulator.

It aims to be simple to use, to maintain and to extend.

It includes a core optimizer using the well tested robust mathematical methods,
a set of user interface utilities and some complete and working examples easily adaptable to
new solar cell technologies.

SLALOM uses, as device simulator, the Silvaco(C) Atlas tool.
It can be easily extended to use any simulator that have a standard input format and a command line interface.
